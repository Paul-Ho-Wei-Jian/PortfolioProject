# Project Aim 
In this project, I showcase my data wrangling skills by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Amazon Prime dataset that is accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows). The dataset contains information about amazon prime's selection of videos with it's ratings, release year, country of production, etc

# How to run it on local machine
1. Clone github repository 
2. Install Streamlit: Start by installing Streamlit on your local machine. You can use pip (Python's package installer) to install it by running the following command in your terminal: pip install streamlit 
3. Run the Streamlit application: To run your application, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Streamlit.py file is located, and use the following command: streamlit run Streamlit.py
4. Iterate and update your application: As you make changes to your Streamlit.py file, you can save it and see the changes automatically reflected in the browser. Streamlit provides hot reloading, so you don't need to restart the server manually.
